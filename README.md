# Backpack Price Prediction - Kaggle
Hi,<br/>
I recently participated in the Backpack Price Prediction competition on Kaggle and worked hard to develop a solid solution. I concluded that XGBoost would be the best approach (it excels with tabular data), and I ended up in 311th place. However, many participants dropped out of the competition due to the strange nature of the data, which has very little signal. Chris Deotte and Ravi Ramakrishnan both highlighted this issue in the forums. I am currently looking for others competition and thinking of participating in them like "NeurIPS Lux AI Season 3" which is, for me looking pretty fun.<br />
