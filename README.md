# Backpack Price Prediction - Kaggle
Hi,
I recently participated in backpack price prediction on Kaggle and worked on it to create a good solution. I arrived to the conclusion of using XGBoost for this (XGBoost is amazing with tabular data) and got the 311th place. But many people quit this competition because of its weird data which has very little signal. (Chris Deotte and Ravi Ramakrishnan pointed this out in the forums).
